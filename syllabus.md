### Reading Activities

The interactive zyBook has "Participation Activities" and "Challenge Activities" throughout the content. These activities
are designed to help you better understand the related material. You are required to complete all assigned readings and
reading activities by the assigned due date. You will not receive credit for reading activities that are  completed
after the due date.

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- 



### Homework

Completion of homework assignments is critical to success in this course. Homework provides an opportunity to practice 
material from lecture and prepare for labs and exams. All homework is due in class, at the beginning of class, on the 
assigned due dates. **Absolutely no late homework will be accepted**. Work that is not turned in will receive a grade of 
zero. All homework must be submitted physically. Digital copies of homework assignments will not be accepted.

**All homework solutions should be easy to read and neatly organized.**

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- 



### Labs

Labs constitute a significant portion of the course grade. Attendance at your assigned section is mandatory. Students 
are required to attend their assigned section to balance instructional loads and ensure sufficient lab resources for 
each student. Labs are designed to be completed within the lab period; however, students may turn in labs at any point 
before their next lab section. Labs will be graded upon the correctness of the solution, adherence to the lab 
instructions, and quality of the lab report.

**You MUST make a legitimate attempt to complete every programming assignment. I reserve the right to fail any student 
who does not make a good faith effort to complete all of the programming assignments. Failure to complete 
and submit two or more programming assignments by their assigned due date will result is a zero for the course.**

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- 



### Exams

Three exams will be given during the semester. These exams will be closed book and closed notes. 
Exams will cover all material up to that point in the semester. 
**No make-up exams will be given without approval of the instructor prior to class unless proof of extreme emergency or 
illness is provided.** A final exam will be given at the end of the semester. This exam is optional and can replace 
your lowest exam grade. All final exams will be in the course lecture room during the final exam period scheduled by 
the college ([link](https://www.ycp.edu/academics/final-exam-schedules/)).

**You must receive a score of 70+ on _at least one exam_ to pass the course.**

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- 



### Attendance Policy

Regular attendance is one of the greatest predictors of academic success. Attendance will not be taken but is expected 
of every student. Cell phones must be silenced during class. All laptops and other devices must be turned off during 
lectures unless explicitly permitted by the instructor.

If you must miss a class, it is your responsibility to notify the professor prior to class. Students are responsible 
for all material covered in class. If you miss class you are still responsible for completing all reading activities 
by the assigned due date. Additionally, if you miss class on a day when homework is due, it is your responsibility to
ensure that the instructor has a _physical_ copy of your homework, in hand, before the beginning of class. 

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- 



### Adverse Weather Policy

During the semester the college may close or be delayed due to adverse weather conditions. As all contingencies cannot 
be anticipated this course will operate under the following directives: 

  1. All students will monitor their emails and the College website for weather updates and follow the Inclement Weather 
  Schedule accordingly ([link](https://www.ycp.edu/academics/inclement-weather-schedule/)).
  2. No student should travel or attempt to travel for a class activity if they believe their safety may be in danger. 
  The student should email the instructor regarding their decision within a reasonable time frame.
  3. Absence from a class activity due to adverse weather does not excuse a student from the assigned work. All course 
  work must be completed per the discretion of the instructor.

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- 



### Collaboration Policy

Students may work together on the homework and lab assignments under the following conditions: (1) each student must 
submit their own solutions to assignments - no copying from another student, solution manual, or other reference and 
(2) you must indicate on your assignment which students you worked with for the solution. Students may use each other, 
the internet, or other resources to help inform their work. These contributions and collaborations must be well cited 
but **no source code, answers, or any other solution may be directly copied, in part or whole, from any source**. Any 
violations of this policy will be considered an Academic Integrity violation. The instructor reserves the right to alter 
this policy at any time during the semester.

While students may discuss course topics and concepts with each other **is it forbidden to copy, or allow your code to be 
copied, by another student**. Student work may be examined for similarities by automated tools. You cannot "fool"
these tools, therefore do not copy from someone/somewhere else.

### Academic Integrity Policy

York College's mission statement stipulates that strict adherence to
principles of academic honesty is expected of all students. Therefore,
academic dishonesty will not be tolerated at York College. Academic
dishonesty refers to actions such as, but not limited to, cheating,
plagiarism, fabricating research, falsifying academic documents, etc.,
and includes all situations where students make use of the work of others
and claim such work as their own.

When a faculty member believes a student has committed an act of academic
dishonesty, the faculty member must promptly notify the student in writing
and obtain confirmation of notification from the student.  The faculty
member then has ten business days from that written notification to
the student to report the incident to the Dean of Academic Affairs and
the Department Chair. Documentation related to instances of academic
dishonesty will be kept on file in the student's permanent record. The
faculty member has full discretion to determine a suitable penalty for
the student, up to a course grade of 0.  This discretion is limited to
the course in which the dishonesty took place.  Students may not withdraw
from a course in which they have been accused of academic dishonesty,
unless and until the accusation is withdrawn by the faculty member or
is overturned by the Student Welfare Committee or the Dean of Academic
Affairs.

Students who believe they have been unjustly charged or sanctioned must
discuss the situation with the faculty member and have 10 business
days thereafter to submit an appeal to Student Welfare Committee
through the Dean of Academic Affairs. If an appeal is filed, the
Student Welfare Committee will then conduct a hearing to review the
charge and/or sanction.  In the case of an egregious first offense, the
faculty member may request that the Student Welfare Committee conduct a
hearing and determine a sanction, which may involve academic probation,
suspension or dismissal from the College.

If the Dean of Academic Affairs determines that the academic dishonesty is
the student's second offense, the Dean will provide written notification
to the student, the faculty member, and the Department Chair. The Student
Welfare Committee will automatically conduct a hearing to review the
charge and decide on an appropriate sanction, which will involve academic
probation, suspension or dismissal from the College. Students who believe
the Student Welfare Committee has unjustly sanctioned them may submit
a written appeal to the Dean of Academic Affairs within 72 hours of
receiving notification of the Student Welfare Committee's sanction.

### Personal Technology Policy

While York College recognizes students' need for educational and emergency-related technological devices such as laptops, 
PDAs, cellular phones, etc., using them unethically or recreationally during class time is never appropriate.  The college 
recognizes and supports faculty members' authority to regulate in their classrooms student use of all electronic devices.

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- 



### Communication Standards

York College recognizes the importance of effective communication in all disciplines and
careers.  Therefore, students are expected to competently analyze, synthesize, organize,
and articulate course material in papers, examinations and presentations.  In addition,
students should know and use communication skills current to their field of study,
recognize the need for revision as part of their writing process, and employ standard
conventions of English usage in both writing and speaking.  Students may be asked to
further revise assignments that do not demonstrate effective use of these communication
skills.

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- 



### Student Accessibility Services

York College of Pennsylvania offers a variety of academic accommodations to students with
documented disabilities to ensure their success. To request accommodations, please contact
Student Accessibility Services at (717) 815-1717 or [sas@ycp.edu](sas@ycp.edu). Student
Accessibility Services will discuss the confidential process of requesting accessibility
services and establish the accommodations for which the student is eligible.
