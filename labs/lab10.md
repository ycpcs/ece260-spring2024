Getting Started
===============

Start by downloading [Lab10_Loop_and_Function_Optimization.zip](Lab10_Loop_and_Function_Optimization.zip), saving it in a **ECE260** directory within your home directory.

From the Windows Start Menu, start a **Cygwin Shell** and run the following commands:

    cd h:
    cd ECE260
    unzip Lab10_Loop_and_Function_Optimization.zip
    cd Lab10_Loop_and_Function_Optimization


The folder contains a Microsoft Word document named **Lab10_Loop_and_Function_Optimization.docx**,
a project folder named **Lab10_Sample_Project**,
a **Documents** folder, and some other miscellaneous files.

The **Lab10_Sample_Project** directory contains a Kiel uVision project that you'll be using throughout this lab assignment.  

The **Documents** directory contains some documentation for ARM-based microprocessors and instruction sets.
  
Open the **Lab10_Loop_and_Function_Optimization.docx** with Microsoft Word.  Additional instructions for this lab assignment are 
included in the Word document.
